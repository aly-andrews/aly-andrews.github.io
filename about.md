      <h2>My philosophy</h2>
      <p>I believe in optimizing for longevity and creating systems that scale. What started as agent profiles and personas has evolved into cursor rules and style guide execution across entire project basis for consistent output. This is my love letter to AI—what I couldn't do ten years ago has become a seamless experience by asking questions and learning on the fly.</p>
      <p>I thrive in trial and error and amplify my output by leveraging technology. Technical writing has evolved in the way we consume things—I no longer write directly to the user. Now, I optimize content to be consumed by an LLM to then distribute to a user.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>AI philosophy and daily drivers</h2>
      <p>I implement specific LLM models for different tasks, use a command folder for repeated execution, and leverage sub-agents for multi-task execution. I test AI across different modalities with voiceover, graphics, UX, and video to understand what works and what doesn't.</p>
      <p>The human element remains critical for reviews and approval. While I can ask the system to generate content, the human element of knowledge repository validation is essential. At Shopify, I connected to MCP servers to pull information, scrape my Slack, calendar, email, Google Hangout transcripts, and GitHub issues to write weekly summaries. This triggered automatically every Wednesday at 8am and sent me a completion notification in Slack, saving 1-2 hours of admin tasks and putting me back into impactful work.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Technical writing optimization</h2>
      <p>I optimize for longevity and keep localization in mind. My approach focuses on creating modular content with reusable partials in the CMS, ensuring documentation can be maintained efficiently and adapted for different regions and languages.</p>
      <p>I've developed unified style guides for LLM training, which reduced pre-production time from 5 days to 1 day. By creating consistent patterns and structures, content becomes more predictable for both AI systems and human editors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Data driven decisions</h2>
      <p>Every piece of content I create is informed by data. I analyze user behavior, support tickets, search queries, and engagement metrics to identify what content is needed and how it should be structured.</p>
      <p>This data-first approach ensures that the content I produce directly addresses user needs and reduces support burden. At Shopify, this methodology helped grow the YouTube channel from 40,000 to over 100,000 subscribers by creating videos that answered the questions users were actually asking.</p>

      <h2>Passion projects</h2>
      <p>Photography is one of my passion projects that demonstrates how I approach everything—with systems thinking and a focus on scalability. What started as a creative outlet during the pandemic grew into a full business with regular clients and sold out mini sessions with waitlists.</p>
      <p>I created scalable business frameworks, developed a new source of income for my family, and found a way to express myself creatively. The same systematic approach I bring to technical writing—understanding user needs, creating consistent processes, and optimizing for outcomes—applied to building a photography business from scratch.</p>
      <p>After starting my Technical Writing program, I've put the business on pause but still take select clients throughout the year for creative joy. You can see my work at <a href="https://alyanne.mypixieset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aly Anne Photography</a>.</p>
