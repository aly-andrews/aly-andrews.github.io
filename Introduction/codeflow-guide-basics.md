# Welcome to CodeFlow

## What is CodeFlow

CodeFlow is an integrated development environment (IDE) that brings code editing, real-time collaboration and debugging tools together in one place. If you're a developer, CodeFlow gives you what you need to write, test and ship your apps without switching between multiple tools. It works for both personal projects that are small and large established enterprise projects. CodeFlow is essential to help you work faster and write better code, no matter your experience level.

## Key features

CodeFlow has a variety of features available designed to improve your workflow. 

Intelligent Code Completion: CodeFlow learns how you write code and suggests what you're likely to type next. It recommends functions, snippets and other code based on your project. This helps you work faster and make fewer mistakes. 

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same code at the same time. You'll see where your teammates are working, changes appear instantly and CodeFlow helps you sort out conflicts when two people edit the same thing.

- **Integrated Debugging Tools**: When your code breaks, CodeFlow helps you figure out why. Set breakpoints, check what's in your variables, trace through your code and see what's slowing things down. All without leaving your workspace.

- **Version Control Integration**: Git works directly inside CodeFlow. Compare different versions of your code, manage branches and check your commit history without switching to another tool.

- **Customizable Workspace**: Set up CodeFlow the way you actually work. Pick your theme, arrange your windows how you want them, install the plugins you need and create keyboard shortcuts that make sense to you.

- **Multi-Language Support**: CodeFlow supports over 50 programming languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust and more. Each language gets syntax highlighting, error detection and proper formatting.

## System requirements

CodeFlow works on these operating systems:

**Windows**: Windows 10 or later

**macOS**: macOS 10.9 or newer

**Linux**: Supported platforms include amd64, x64, and arm64
