# Setting up collaboration 

Collaboration in CodeFlow lets you and your teammates work on the same code simultaneously. You see changes as they happen, know where everyone's working and resolve any conflicts right away.

## Set up

Before you start collaborating, you need to set up your project for sharing.

1. Open your project in CodeFlow
2. Click the **Share** button in the top right corner
3. Choose your sharing permissions (edit access, view access, or comment access)
4. Generate a sharing link or invite people by email
5. Click **Start collaboration session**

> **Note**: Make sure everyone on your team has CodeFlow installed and is signed in before you share the link.

## Active session

When your session is active, you see cursors showing where each person is working. Changes appear on the screen as teammates type them. Small dots next to filenames show which files people are viewing. The collaboration panel shows who's currently in the session.

The chat keeps conversations connected to your code and the activity feed shows what's changing in real time. CodeFlow auto saves your work, but manual saves create clear checkpoints for your team.

> **Warning**: If two people edit the exact same line at the same time, CodeFlow will pause and ask you to resolve the conflict. This only takes a few seconds, but it's easier to avoid by coordinating which sections you're each working on.

## Code conflicts

Sometimes you and a teammate will edit the same code at the same time. Here's how to handle it:

1. CodeFlow will highlight the conflicting section in yellow
2. Both versions of the code are shown 
3. Choose which version to keep, or combine them manually
4. Click **Resolve** to confirm your choice
5. The conflict disappears and everyone sees the resolved version

Most conflicts happen when the activity feed is not being monitored. Common scenarios include two people renaming the same variable differently or multiple people reformatting the same section.

## Closing the session

When you're done collaborating:

1. Click the **Share** button again
2. Select **End collaboration session**
3. All participants will be notified the session has ended
4. Changes are saved and the project returns to single user mode

> **Note**: Ending the session does not remove people from the project. Files can be accessed through the repo.
