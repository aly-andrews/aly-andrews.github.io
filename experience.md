        <h2>Things I love</h2>
        <p>I've always been someone who needs to have a passion hobby outside of my work. A few years ago it was cooking and then I discovered my love of photography during the pandemic. What started out as a few portraits of friends and family, grew into an entire business with regular clients and sold out mini sessions with waitlists.</p>
        <p>Not only did I prove again that I can create scalable business frameworks, I created a new source of income for my family and found a way to express myself creatively. After starting my Technical Writing program, I've since put a pause in my photography business, but still take a few clients throughout the year for creative joy.</p>
