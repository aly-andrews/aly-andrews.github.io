      <h2 class="section-title">Content philosophies</h2>

  <p>I'm user-centric at the core.</p>

  <p>I care about <strong>who</strong> will read or watch my content, <strong>what they need to do</strong>, and whether what I'm shipping actually helps them solve problems. I love taking complex topics and making them easy to understand—so users feel empowered to self-serve.</p>

  <p>There's something deeply satisfying about taking an abstract idea and turning it into something tangible: a help center doc, an Academy course, a technical style guide, a how-to video, or even a website like this one.</p>

  <p>Whether I was at Shopify, DrInfo, or working on my own projects, the thread running through my content philosophy has always been the same:</p>

  <p class="highlight-line"><strong>Start with the user. Write with clarity. Build with intention.</strong></p>

  <p>Another philosophy I heavily subscribe to: <strong>data</strong>.</p>

  <p>It’s not enough to ship a piece of content and hope it works. I dig into the data behind what I’ve already built—and what I <em>will</em> build.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>People are not afraid to tell you what they want, what works, and what doesn’t. I firmly believe we should take the time to listen.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This listening might show up as retention rates, drop-off points, high volumes of support tickets on a particular topic, or even just comments on a video.</p>

  <p>I use this information not only to build exactly what users are asking for, but also to explore new ways of presenting information—different modalities and formats that speak more directly to how they learn and work.</p>

  <p>My career has been an organic evolution: trial and error, chasing learning opportunities, and constant iteration.</p>

  <p>I’ve now formalized that journey with a Technical Writing Graduate Certificate from Algonquin College (graduating summer 2026). It gives me a unique vantage point of learning traditional technical writing methods while simultaneously building for the future by writing for LLMs.</p>

  <p>There’s real art in weaving strong writing fundamentals together with emerging technology. We’re literally building the plane as we fly it and I warmly welcome that change.</p>

  <p>I invite others to meet me at this intersection of evolution.</p>

    <!-- Hidden popup content (used by skillset popup) -->
    <div id="popup-content-ai-automation" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I use AI and automation to scale content work, keep tone and style consistent and support repeatable workflows. This includes prompt design, tool evaluation and integrating AI into drafting, editing and daily admin so teams can ship faster without sacrificing quality.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="popup-content-content-production" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I start with audience and task: what does the user need to do, and what format best serves that. I focus on clear structure, consistent style and reusable content so the same information can live in multiple places without drift. Writing and structure come first; format follows.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="popup-content-analytics" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I treat analytics as part of content strategy. I define what success looks like, track it consistently and change goals when the audience or product changes. I use completion, engagement and growth in context to prioritize what to double down on and what to shorten. When metrics need to evolve, I document the shift and set a new baseline.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="popup-content-technical-writing" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I treat technical writing as a system: audience first, then structure, style and delivery. I define personas, break down tasks into goal, steps and outcome, and choose the right format for the audience. I aim for concise, active voice and chunked sections, and I separate content from formatting so single-source and reuse are possible. When something is out of date I assess urgency and scope before triaging and give candid feedback when both sides are not emotional.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="popup-content-leadership" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I lead as an individual contributor and as a formal lead. I act as connector between teams, advocate for quality and realistic expectations and build process so others can succeed. I mentor on documentation standards, style guides and workflows, run workshops on writing and structure, and create onboarding docs and 30-60-90 check-ins. I design hiring processes, lead interviews and create onboarding materials. I build systems to track requests and lay ground rules when feedback conflicts or there is no clear owner.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="popup-content-video-photography" class="skillset-popup-content" hidden aria-hidden="true">
      <p>I approach video and photography with the same user-centric and systems thinking I bring to documentation. For video I focus on scripting and storyboarding first, then coordination and delivery. For photography I focus on understanding the client, clear process and scalable workflows. Both are about clarity, structure and intention.</p>
