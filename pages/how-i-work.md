      <h2>Who I am as a worker</h2>
      <p>I'm user centric at the core. I care about who will read it, what they need to do, and whether the content actually helps. I love writing—clear, structured, purposeful—and I love building programs from scratch. There's something deeply satisfying about taking a simple idea and turning it into something tangible: a help center, a course, a style guide, or even a website like this one. I've done that at Shopify (2017–2026) across educational content and knowledge systems, from coordinating support and help content to scaling a content team and later focusing on articles, courses and learning outcomes as Senior Education Content Producer. The thread is always the same: start with the user, write with clarity, and build something that lasts.</p>
      <p>I use data to decide what to make and how to measure success. I track completion and behavior change; I redefine success when the audience or product changes (e.g. deflection to learning outcomes). I formalized my practice with a Technical Writing Graduate Certificate (Algonquin College, part time, online, 2024–2026), which gave me a shared language for audience analysis, single-source documentation, instructional design and docs as code. I treat technical writing as a system: audience and task analysis, style and structure, visual design, managing change and delivery via Git, static sites, and CMS/LMS platforms like Skilljar.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I start with audience and task: what does the user need to do, and what format best serves that (article, help topic, video script, course module)? I focus on clear structure, consistent style and reusable content so the same information can live in multiple places without drift. Writing and structure come first; format follows. When the deliverable is video, I handle scripting and coordination and work with production as needed.</p>

        <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">How I approach analytics</summary>
        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I treat analytics as part of content strategy. I define what success looks like (completion, retention, behavior change, learning outcomes), track it consistently, and change goals when the audience or product changes.</p>
          <p><strong>What I track and why:</strong> Completion and engagement are quality signals for help content and courses (e.g. completion funnel, time on task). I read growth in context: organic use, spikes tied to launches or seasons, and the effect of capacity on release cadence. Top performers consistently reflect "getting started" and setup content; I use that to prioritize what to double down on and what to shorten or restructure. Impact beyond raw views matters—e.g. contextual learning that led to measurable behavior change (e.g. gift card issuance) validated investing in in-product and in-admin content.</p>
          <p><strong>Trends I act on:</strong> Short, focused content and course intros outperform long tutorials. Delisting or archiving outdated content is a deliberate choice; I accept short-term traffic loss to reduce support debt and protect trust. When success metrics have to evolve, I document the shift and set a new baseline rather than clinging to old numbers.</p>

      <details class="portfolio-accordion" id="technical-writing-accordion">
        <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">How I approach technical writing</summary>
        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I treat technical writing as a system: audience first, then structure, style, and delivery.</p>
          <p><strong>Audience and task analysis:</strong> I define primary personas (e.g. Business Owner vs User), scope and demographics; I break down tasks into goal, steps, and outcome. I use that to choose the right format (hover text, tours, user manual, video, course module) and to plan for localization when expansion is planned.</p>
          <p><strong>Style and structure:</strong> I use sentence case for all headings, no Oxford comma, and consistent list and table punctuation. I aim for concise, active voice and chunked sections. I separate content from formatting so that single-source and reuse are possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Visual design:</strong> I think in terms of arrangement, emphasis, clarity and tone. I use screen captures sparingly and consistently (size, callouts, gray out irrelevant areas) and include alt text for accessibility.</p>
          <p><strong>Managing change:</strong> I align with SMEs' and stakeholders' PM tools, follow product rollout streams (newsletters, Slack, email), and when something is out of date I assess urgency, scope and communication gaps before triaging. I avoid blame and don't participate in the panic; I give candid feedback when both sides are not emotional and hold boundaries so that hasty updates don't create more work later.</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> I use Git workflows (branch, PR, review, merge) and Markdown for documentation; I've worked with Docusaurus for versioning and single-source sites and with MadCap Flare for structured help. For learning content I use CMS and LMS platforms like Skilljar for course structure, gated content and publishing. At Shopify I applied this through the Video Style Guide, script standards, help doc embedding and Academy course structure with learner-centered objectives.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <h3>Merchant Success Manager (2017–2018)</h3>
          <p>I coordinated support and educational content for merchants and built the foundation for later help content and education work. I applied customer segment and localization awareness that carried into Help Center content and international expansion.</p>
          <h3>Video Producer → Senior Video Producer (2018–2021)</h3>
          <p>I took ownership of educational content strategy and delivery for Help Center (including video as one channel). I focused on scripting, structure, SEO and cross functional stakeholder management, grew reach through organic traffic to 100K+ subscribers, led the POS content series (including the rescue when Start and Studios were pulled three days before launch), drove the COVID 19 content response (gift cards, local pickup, store policies), and mentored others on content quality and SEO. I learned to advocate for quality, set expectations, and say no when a request was impossible. I built a system to track and prioritize requests and acted as connector between teams that hadn't known the Help content program existed.</p>
          <h3>Video Production Lead (2021–2023)</h3>
          <p>I built and managed a team of 11 producing educational content for Help Center and eventually content across 14 languages. I designed the hiring process, created onboarding and 30-60-90 documentation, ran impact reviews and Burst planning, and developed content roadmaps from support data and quarterly goals. When the team moved from Support to Revenue and shifted focus from merchants to enterprise partners, I navigated the re-org and the shift from YouTube to Shopify Academy courses. I chose to step back from people leadership and return to individual contributor work.</p>
          <h3>Senior Education Content Producer (2023–2026)</h3>
          <p>On Education and Enablement (Shopify Academy), later External Education (E3), I combined articles, course development and video when it was the right format. I redefined success metrics from deflection to learning outcomes, pioneered Reprise adoption, managed external vendors, and integrated AI tools (NotebookLM, ElevenLabs, Descript, Claude-based agents) into content workflows. I led Wistia migration (Vidyard to Wistia, folders, tags, self serve docs), ran Lunch n Learns on AI and Reprise, and used GitHub for project tracking and stakeholder accountability.</p>

          <p>I lead both as an individual contributor and as a formal lead. I act as connector between teams, advocate for quality and realistic expectations, and build process so that others can succeed.</p>
          <p>I've mentored peers on documentation standards, style guides, content and writing workflows, structure and reuse, and onboarding and process docs. I've run workshops on writing for different formats, script and structure, and content quality. I create onboarding docs and 30-60-90 check-ins so that new hires have a clear path. I've designed hiring processes (role definitions, interview frameworks, candidate evaluation criteria), led key interviews, and created structured onboarding and training materials. I build systems to track and prioritize requests and make the schedule visible. I lay ground rules when there's conflicting feedback or no clear owner, and I provide post mortem feedback so we don't repeat the same failure mode. I've learned to say no when a request is impossible and to push for clarity before committing.</p>

      <h2>Passion projects</h2>
      <p>Photography is one of my passion projects that demonstrates how I approach everything—with systems thinking and a focus on scalability. What started as a creative outlet during the pandemic grew into a full business with regular clients and sold out mini sessions with waitlists.</p>
      <p>I created scalable business frameworks, developed a new source of income for my family, and found a way to express myself creatively. The same systematic approach I bring to technical writing—understanding user needs, creating consistent processes, and optimizing for outcomes—applied to building a photography business from scratch.</p>
      <p>After starting my Technical Writing program, I've put the business on pause but still take select clients throughout the year for creative joy. You can see my work at <a href="https://alyanne.mypixieset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aly Anne Photography</a>.</p>
