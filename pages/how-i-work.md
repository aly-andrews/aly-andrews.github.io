      <h2>Content philosophies</h2>
      <p>I'm user centric at the core. I care about who will read/watch my content, what they need to do and whether what I'm shipping actually helps them problem solve. I love taking complex topics and making them easy to understand for users so they feel empowered to self-serve. There's something deeply satisfying about taking an idea and turning it into something tangible: a help center doc, an Academy course, a technical style guide, a how-to video or even a website like this one.</p>
      <p>Whether I was at Shopify, DrInfo or working on my own projects, the thread for my content philosophy is always the same: start with the user, write with clarity and build with intention.</p>
      <p>Another content philosophy I heavily subscribe to? Data. It's not enough to just ship a piece of content and hope it works. I get into the weeds of the data behind what I've built and also what I *will* build. People are not afraid to tell you what they want, what works and what doesn't. I firmly believe we should take the time to listen. This might look like retention rates, drop-off points, high-volume of support tickets on a topic or even just comments on a video. I use this information to not only build what users are asking for, but explore the modalities and information presented in ways that speak to them.</p>
      <p>My career has been an organic evolution through trial and error and seeking learning opportunities. I've formalized my skillset with a Technical Writing Graduate Certificate (Algonquin College, graduating summer 2026). This gives me a unique perspective of learning traditional technical writing methods, while simultaneously building for the future as I learn to write for LLM's. There is an art to weaving the writing fundamentals while embracing the technology before us. To build the plane as we fly it, so to speak.</p>
      <p>I warmly welcome this change and invite others to meet me at the intersection of this evolution.</p>

        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I start with audience and task: what does the user need to do, and what format best serves that (article, help topic, video script, course module)? I focus on clear structure, consistent style and reusable content so the same information can live in multiple places without drift. Writing and structure come first; format follows. When the deliverable is video, I handle scripting and coordination and work with production as needed.</p>

        <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">Strategy and analytics</summary>
        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I treat analytics as part of content strategy. I define what success looks like (completion, retention, behavior change, learning outcomes), track it consistently, and change goals when the audience or product changes.</p>
          <p><strong>What I track and why:</strong> Completion and engagement are quality signals for help content and courses (e.g. completion funnel, time on task). I read growth in context: organic use, spikes tied to launches or seasons, and the effect of capacity on release cadence. Top performers consistently reflect "getting started" and setup content; I use that to prioritize what to double down on and what to shorten or restructure. Impact beyond raw views matters—e.g. contextual learning that led to measurable behavior change (e.g. gift card issuance) validated investing in in-product and in-admin content.</p>
          <p><strong>Trends I act on:</strong> Short, focused content and course intros outperform long tutorials. Delisting or archiving outdated content is a deliberate choice; I accept short-term traffic loss to reduce support debt and protect trust. When success metrics have to evolve, I document the shift and set a new baseline rather than clinging to old numbers.</p>

      <details class="portfolio-accordion" id="technical-writing-accordion">
        <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">Technical writing and documentation</summary>
        <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
          <p>I treat technical writing as a system: audience first, then structure, style, and delivery.</p>
          <p><strong>Audience and task analysis:</strong> I define primary personas (e.g. Business Owner vs User), scope and demographics; I break down tasks into goal, steps, and outcome. I use that to choose the right format (hover text, tours, user manual, video, course module) and to plan for localization when expansion is planned.</p>
          <p><strong>Style and structure:</strong> I use sentence case for all headings, no Oxford comma, and consistent list and table punctuation. I aim for concise, active voice and chunked sections. I separate content from formatting so that single-source and reuse are possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Visual design:</strong> I think in terms of arrangement, emphasis, clarity and tone. I use screen captures sparingly and consistently (size, callouts, gray out irrelevant areas) and include alt text for accessibility.</p>
          <p><strong>Managing change:</strong> I align with SMEs' and stakeholders' PM tools, follow product rollout streams (newsletters, Slack, email), and when something is out of date I assess urgency, scope and communication gaps before triaging. I avoid blame and don't participate in the panic; I give candid feedback when both sides are not emotional and hold boundaries so that hasty updates don't create more work later.</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> I use Git workflows (branch, PR, review, merge) and Markdown for documentation; I've worked with Docusaurus for versioning and single-source sites and with MadCap Flare for structured help. For learning content I use CMS and LMS platforms like Skilljar for course structure, gated content and publishing. At Shopify I applied this through the Video Style Guide, script standards, help doc embedding and Academy course structure with learner-centered objectives.</p>

          <p>I lead both as an individual contributor and as a formal lead. I act as connector between teams, advocate for quality and realistic expectations, and build process so that others can succeed.</p>
          <p>I've mentored peers on documentation standards, style guides, content and writing workflows, structure and reuse, and onboarding and process docs. I've run workshops on writing for different formats, script and structure, and content quality. I create onboarding docs and 30-60-90 check-ins so that new hires have a clear path. I've designed hiring processes (role definitions, interview frameworks, candidate evaluation criteria), led key interviews, and created structured onboarding and training materials. I build systems to track and prioritize requests and make the schedule visible. I lay ground rules when there's conflicting feedback or no clear owner, and I provide post mortem feedback so we don't repeat the same failure mode. I've learned to say no when a request is impossible and to push for clarity before committing.</p>

Both are about clarity, structure and intention—whether the output is a help video, a course module or a portrait session.</p>
