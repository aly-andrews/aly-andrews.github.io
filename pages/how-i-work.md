      <h2>Who I am as a worker</h2>
      <p>I move between hands-on production and strategy. At Shopify (2017–2026) I went from coordinating support and educational content as a Merchant Success Manager to building the Help Center YouTube channel from the ground up as a Video Producer, then scaling to a team of 11 as Video Production Lead. I grew the English channel through organic traffic, led high impact projects (POS series rescue, COVID 19 video response, Digitize Canada, Support Summit), and developed from basic video editor to full production: scripting, hosting, directing, SEO and cross functional stakeholder management. When the video team moved from Support to Revenue and shifted focus from merchants to enterprise partners, I chose to return to individual contributor work as Senior Education Content Producer on Shopify Academy (later External Education, E3). There I combined video with articles and course development, pioneered Reprise adoption, returned to on camera hosting, managed external vendors, and integrated AI tools into workflows.</p>
      <p>I use data to decide what to make and how to measure success. I track retention, watch time and behavior change; I redefine success when the audience or product changes (e.g. deflection to learning outcomes). I formalized my documentation and learning practice with a Technical Writing Graduate Certificate (Algonquin College, part time, online, 2024–2026), which gave me a shared language for audience analysis, single-source documentation, instructional design and docs as code. I treat technical writing as a system: audience and task analysis, style and structure, visual design, managing change and delivery via Git, static sites, and CMS/LMS platforms like Skilljar.</p>

      <h2>How I approach analytics</h2>
        <p>I treat analytics as part of content strategy. I define what success looks like (views, retention and behavior change), track it consistently, and change goals when the audience or product changes.</p>
        <p><strong>What I track and why:</strong> Retention and watch time are quality signals (on YouTube I aimed for 48–50% average view duration; on Wistia I use engagement % and completion funnel the same way). Subscriber and view growth I read in context: organic growth, spikes tied to BFCM or new store creation, and the effect of team capacity on release cadence. Top performers consistently reflect "getting started" and setup content; I use that to prioritize what to double down on and what to shorten or restructure. Impact beyond views matters—e.g. the COVID Gift Card video: 459 merchants watched it; those merchants collectively issued $2.3M USD in gift cards. That validated investing in contextual, in-admin learning and helped argue for the value of video beyond view counts.</p>
        <p><strong>Trends I act on:</strong> Short, focused content (under 2 min) and course intros outperform long tutorials and webinars. Delisting outdated or rebranded content is a deliberate choice; I accept short-term view loss to reduce support debt and protect trust. When success metrics have to evolve, I document the shift and set a new baseline rather than clinging to old numbers.</p>

      <h2>How I approach technical writing</h2>
        <p>I treat technical writing as a system: audience first, then structure, style, and delivery.</p>
        <p><strong>Audience and task analysis:</strong> I define primary personas (e.g. Business Owner vs User), scope and demographics; I break down tasks into goal, steps, and outcome. I use that to choose the right format (hover text, tours, user manual, video, course module) and to plan for localization when expansion is planned.</p>
        <p><strong>Style and structure:</strong> I use sentence case for all headings, no Oxford comma, and consistent list and table punctuation. I aim for concise, active voice and chunked sections. I separate content from formatting so that single-source and reuse are possible.</p>
        <p><strong>Visual design:</strong> I think in terms of arrangement, emphasis, clarity and tone. I use screen captures sparingly and consistently (size, callouts, gray out irrelevant areas) and include alt text for accessibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Managing change:</strong> I align with SMEs' and stakeholders' PM tools, follow product rollout streams (newsletters, Slack, email), and when something is out of date I assess urgency, scope and communication gaps before triaging. I avoid blame and don't participate in the panic; I give candid feedback when both sides are not emotional and hold boundaries so that hasty updates don't create more work later.</p>
        <p><strong>Delivery:</strong> I use Git workflows (branch, PR, review, merge) and Markdown for documentation; I've worked with Docusaurus for versioning and single-source sites and with MadCap Flare for structured help. For learning content I use CMS and LMS platforms like Skilljar for course structure, gated content and publishing. At Shopify I applied this through the Video Style Guide, script standards, help doc embedding and Academy course structure with learner-centered objectives.</p>

          <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">Career timeline (expand)</summary>
          <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
            <h3>Merchant Success Manager (2017–2018)</h3>
            <p>I coordinated support and educational content for merchants and built the foundation for later video and education work. I applied customer segment and localization awareness that carried into Help Center video and international expansion.</p>
            <h3>Video Producer → Senior Video Producer (2018–2021)</h3>
            <p>I took ownership of the Help Center YouTube channel and built it from the ground up. I went from screen recordings and voiceover to full solo production: scripting, hosting, directing, SEO and cross functional stakeholder management. I grew the channel through organic traffic to 100K+ subscribers, led the POS series (including the rescue when Start and Studios were pulled three days before launch), drove the COVID 19 video response (gift cards, local pickup, store policies), and mentored others on production and SEO. I learned to advocate for quality, set expectations, and say no when a request was impossible. I built a system to track and prioritize requests and acted as connector between teams that hadn't known the Help YouTube channel existed.</p>
            <h3>Video Production Lead (2021–2023)</h3>
            <p>I built and managed a team of 11 producing educational video for Help Center YouTube and eventually content across 14 languages. I designed the hiring process, created onboarding and 30-60-90 documentation, ran impact reviews and Burst planning, and developed content roadmaps from support data and quarterly goals. When the video team moved from Support to Revenue and shifted focus from merchants to enterprise partners, I navigated the re-org and the shift from YouTube to Shopify Academy courses. I chose to step back from people leadership and return to individual contributor work.</p>
            <h3>Senior Education Content Producer (2023–2026)</h3>
            <p>On Education and Enablement (Shopify Academy), later External Education (E3), I combined video with articles and course development. I redefined video success metrics from deflection to learning outcomes, pioneered Reprise adoption, returned to on camera hosting (e.g. Shopify Flow, Admin), managed external vendors, and integrated AI tools (NotebookLM, ElevenLabs, Descript, Claude-based agents) into workflows. I led Wistia migration (Vidyard to Wistia, folders, tags, self serve docs), ran Lunch n Learns on AI and Reprise, and used GitHub for project tracking and stakeholder accountability.</p>

      <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>I lead both as an individual contributor and as a formal lead. I act as connector between teams, advocate for quality and realistic expectations, and build process so that others can succeed.</p>
        <p>I've mentored peers on script writing, video production software, transitions, voiceover, editing, upload/embed and SEO. I've run workshops on screen recording, script/storyboarding, audio workflow, uploading to YouTube and delisting. I create onboarding docs and 30-60-90 check-ins so that new hires have a clear path. I've designed hiring processes (role definitions, interview frameworks, candidate evaluation criteria), led key interviews, and created structured onboarding and training materials. I build systems to track and prioritize requests and make the schedule visible. I lay ground rules when there's conflicting feedback or no clear owner, and I provide post mortem feedback so we don't repeat the same failure mode. I've learned to say no when a request is impossible and to push for clarity before committing.</p>

          <summary class="portfolio-accordion-heading">Key moments (expand)</summary>
          <div class="portfolio-accordion-content">
            <p><strong>Shipping Profiles launch (2019):</strong> The feature kept changing up to and after launch; there was conflicting feedback and no clear owner for sign off. I learned to push back, lay ground rules, and provide a post mortem. My manager fully backed the decision. I now avoid simultaneous launches when release management isn't set up for it.</p>
            <p><strong>POS project rescue (2020):</strong> Start and Studios were pulled off three days before launch; every video needed edits and I had no working files. I delivered alone: recorded updated POS screen recordings on my iPad, made edits on 20 videos without working files, and created 2 new videos in time for launch. I learned that I can deliver under extreme pressure and that I should take full credit when I'm the reason something shipped.</p>
            <p><strong>Rebrand (2020):</strong> 130 videos were outdated after the Shopify and Oberlo admin rebrand. I learned After Effects, prioritized Shopify remakes, and accepted that delisting Oberlo would cut views in the short term to reduce support debt and protect trust.</p>
            <p><strong>Return and ramp-up (2021):</strong> I returned gradually to full capacity (scripts, onboarding docs, refamiliarizing with Premiere). Injuries and RSI had set back work earlier in the year. I learned to hand off clearly and to ramp back at a sustainable pace.</p>
            <p><strong>Leadership support (2025):</strong> I experienced frustration with lack of support from my lead. I'm treating it as a learning opportunity for clearer communication and for asking for what I need explicitly.</p>

      <h2>Passion projects</h2>
      <p>Photography is one of my passion projects that demonstrates how I approach everything—with systems thinking and a focus on scalability. What started as a creative outlet during the pandemic grew into a full business with regular clients and sold out mini sessions with waitlists.</p>
      <p>I created scalable business frameworks, developed a new source of income for my family, and found a way to express myself creatively. The same systematic approach I bring to technical writing—understanding user needs, creating consistent processes, and optimizing for outcomes—applied to building a photography business from scratch.</p>
      <p>After starting my Technical Writing program, I've put the business on pause but still take select clients throughout the year for creative joy. You can see my work at <a href="https://alyanne.mypixieset.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aly Anne Photography</a>.</p>
