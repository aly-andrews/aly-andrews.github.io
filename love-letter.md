    <h1>A love letter to AI</h1>

      <p>What I couldn't do ten years ago has become a seamless experience by asking questions and learning on the fly. What started as agent profiles and personas has evolved into cursor rules and style guide execution across entire project basis for consistent output.</p>
      <p>This is my love letter to AI—a reflection on how technology has amplified my capabilities as a technical writer and transformed the way I create, optimize, and distribute content.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>The evolution of technical writing</h2>
      <p>Technical writing has evolved in the way we consume things. I no longer write directly to the user. Now, I optimize content to be consumed by an LLM to then distribute to a user. This fundamental shift changes everything—from structure to language to how we think about reusability.</p>
      <p>I thrive in trial and error and amplify my output through systematic experimentation. Testing AI across different modalities—voiceover, graphics, UX, video—helps me understand what works and what doesn't. Each test informs the next iteration, building a knowledge base of effective patterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>My AI philosophy and daily drivers</h2>
      <p>I implement specific LLM models for different tasks, maintaining a command folder for repeated execution. This systematic approach ensures consistency while allowing for specialized optimization. Each model serves a specific purpose, from content generation to editing to technical validation.</p>
      <p>Sub-agents handle multi-task execution, breaking complex workflows into manageable, automated steps. What started as simple prompts has evolved into sophisticated systems that handle research, drafting, editing, and formatting—all while maintaining my voice and meeting technical requirements.</p>
      <p>But the human element remains essential. I still need reviews and approval. I can ask the system to generate content, but the human element of knowledge repository validation stays intact. AI amplifies capabilities; it doesn't replace judgment.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Real world automation: A case study</h2>
      <p>At Shopify, I connected to MCP servers to pull information and scrape my Slack, calendar, email, Google Hangout transcripts, and GitHub issues. The system would write weekly summaries following a standardized presentation template and push them to GitHub for leadership updates.</p>
      <p>This triggered automatically every Wednesday at 8am and sent me a completion notification in Slack in a private channel. The result? Saving 1-2 hours of admin tasks and putting myself back into impactful work. This isn't about replacing work—it's about eliminating busywork so I can focus on what matters.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Optimizing for longevity and scale</h2>
      <p>Every piece of content I create considers longevity and localization. I keep modular content structures top of mind, building reusable partials in the CMS that can be maintained efficiently and adapted for different regions and languages.</p>
      <p>The unified style guides I developed for LLM training reduced pre-production time from 5 days to 1 day. By creating consistent patterns and structures, content becomes more predictable for both AI systems and human editors. The investment in systematic thinking pays dividends at scale.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Data driven decisions</h2>
      <p>AI enables data-driven content creation at a scale previously impossible. I analyze user behavior, support tickets, search queries, and engagement metrics to identify what content is needed and how it should be structured.</p>
      <p>This approach helped grow the Shopify Help Center YouTube channel to over 100,000 subscribers within 2 years. Every video was informed by data—questions users were asking, topics with high support volume, gaps in existing documentation. AI helped process and pattern-match across thousands of data points to surface what mattered most.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Looking forward</h2>
      <p>I'm excited about the future of AI-augmented technical writing. As LLMs become more sophisticated and integrations deepen, the possibilities expand. But the core principles remain: systematic thinking, data-driven decisions, human validation, and optimization for longevity.</p>
      <p>AI isn't replacing technical writers—it's empowering us to do work that was previously impossible. It's my co-pilot, my research assistant, my pattern matcher, and my tireless collaborator. And I'm just getting started.</p>

      <h2>Don't forget</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical writing:</strong> Optimize for longevity and keep in mind localization, modular content for reusable partials in the CMS</li>
        <li><strong>Data driven decisions:</strong> Every piece of content informed by analytics and user behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Passion projects:</strong> Photography as proof that systematic thinking applies to any domain</li>
        <li><strong>AI philosophy:</strong> Specific LLM models for different tasks, command folder for repeated execution, sub-agents for complex workflows</li>
      </ul>
